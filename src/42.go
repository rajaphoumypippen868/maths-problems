        1. Let A be a set of integers such that the sum of all elements in A is 0.
        2. Find all subsets of A where the sum of the elements in each subset is also 0.

        Solution: 
            - To find all subsets with a given sum, one approach is to use an algorithm similar to the ones used for finding subsets without sums (e.g., 960).
              - We can generate a list of numbers from 1 to n and then check if any subset's elements add up to 0.

            - If we are interested in subsets where the sum is exactly K, we can use a similar approach with a modified set A for each subset.
              - For example, if K = 3, we would generate a list of numbers from 1 to n, filter out those that do not add up to 0, and then keep only those whose sum matches K.

            - Another approach is to use dynamic programming: create two arrays, dpA[i] to store the maximum subset sums ending at index i with an element added,
              and dpB[i] to store the maximum subset sums ending at index i without any elements. By iterating through the input list, we can calculate
              dpA[n+1] = sum(dpA[0:n]) - dpB[1] (if not present) and dpB[i] if it exists.
              - The result is the max value of both arrays.

            - For subsets with a specific sum, we could also use backtracking or another efficient algorithm like the one for finding all subsets without sums,
              as discussed in problem 793.
